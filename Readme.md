# Taste Based Classification of Flavour Molecules
Flavor of a molecule is defined in terms of the gustatory
and olfactory sensation during tasting. The analysis of flavor
profiles has various applications in the food industry, such as
synthesis of artificial flavors, enhancing flavors in food and
checking of adulteration in food. In this project, an attempt
at taste based classification, to understand taste, an aspect
of flavor, was made, to understand and analyze the taste
and flavor profiles of various compounds based on physico-
chemical and ADMET properties.
